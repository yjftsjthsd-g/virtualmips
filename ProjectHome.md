## News ##
2008-10-16 Many days before last release. Maybe the todo list will be "todo" forever!

2008-07-29 The jit part of pavo emulation is not mature, aka it has some critical bugs. Please set jit\_use = 0 to disable JIT in pavo.conf.

2008-07-29 I found someone has tried virtualmips for adm5120 based router emulation and complained that the bootloader worked on router does not work on virtualmips. That is true. Virtualmips is just an emulator and it does **NOT** emulate all the devices of adm5120. If the error message is like this "no device!cpu->pc 9fc0081c vaddr a1022000 paddr 1022000 ", that means the devices on virtual address 0xa1022000 is not emulated. You can dig into it and fix it.
